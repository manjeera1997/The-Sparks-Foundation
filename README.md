## Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level-Intermediate)

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.


Solution - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
